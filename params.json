  "body": "# GoogleIt\r\nA bare bones, always on top web browser utility to constantly search the web for answers.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n1. Ubiquitous - GoogleIt stays with you no matter what you are doing, when you are doing, because it's always on top of everything (pun intended).\r\n2. Network Indicator - The small green box next to the title is the signal indicator, turning red if the internet goes down.\r\n3. Smart minimise - Double tap anywhere on the taskbar and Whoosh! Its minimised. No need to find the damn minimise button.\r\n4. Small - Due to its bare bones nature, its soft on the resources.\r\n5. Smart Drag and Drop - Like a page? Just drag and drop it. And let GoogleIt handle the rest.\r\n6. Smart Home: Click on the GoogleIt icon and reach the Google home page no matter where you are.\r\n\r\n\r\n**PS.** Use your taskbar to close GoogleIt(Close button has been removed to keep it barebones).\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n1. The source code provided is in the form of a visual studio project.\r\n2. Download the package.\r\n3. Open the project using Visual Studio 2013 or above.\r\n4. The form1.cs file contains the logic related codes.\r\n5. The form1.Designer.cs contains the UI related codes.\r\n\r\n##Update\r\n- **Good News:** GoogleIt [initial installer](https://github.com/NilanjanDaw/GoogleIt/releases) is alive. Check out the release section.\r\n\r\n## TO-DO\r\nThe current version uses the Windows Forms based WebBrowser, however it has got serious perfomance issues. For better performance, a Chromium based WebBrowser client must be used.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n[MIT](https://github.com/NilanjanDaw/GoogleIt/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n",
