# GoogleIt
A bare bones, always on top web browser utility to constantly search the web for answers.

## Features
1. Ubiquitous - GoogleIt stays with you no matter what you are doing, when you are doing.
2. Network Indicator - The small green box next to the title is the signal indicator, turning red if the internet goes down.
3. Smart minimise - Double tap anywhere and Whoosh! Its minimised. No need to find the damn minimise button.
4. Small - Due to its bare bones nature, its soft on the resources.

## Instructions

1. The source code provided is in the form of a visual studio project.
2. Download the package.
3. Open visual studio 2013 and above. Open the project.
4. The form1.cs file contains the logic related codes.
5. The form1.Designer.cs contains the UI related codes.
6. A ready to install binary will be released soon after all the components have been integrated.

## TO-DO
The current version uses the Windows Forms based WebBrowser, however it has got serious perfomance issues. For better performance, a Chromium based WebBrowser client must be used.
