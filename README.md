# GoogleIt
A bare bones, always on top web browser utility to constantly search the web for answers.

## Features
1. Ubiquitous - GoogleIt stays with you no matter what you are doing, when you are doing, because it's always on top of everything (pun intended).
2. Network Indicator - The small green box next to the title is the signal indicator, turning red if the internet goes down.
3. Smart minimise - Double tap anywhere on the taskbar and Whoosh! Its minimised. No need to find the damn minimise button.
4. Small - Due to its bare bones nature, its soft on the resources.
5. Smart Drag and Drop - Like a page? Just drag and drop it. And let GoogleIt handle the rest.
6. Smart Home: Click on the GoogleIt icon and reach the Google home page no matter where you are.


**PS.** Use your taskbar to close GoogleIt(Close button has been removed to keep it barebones).
